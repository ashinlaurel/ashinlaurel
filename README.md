# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi, I am Ashin Laurel. I am currently working as SDE 2 at Here Technologies. I graduated from BITS Goa India with a double major in Computer Science Engineering And Economics.
I have been passionate in developing innovative and scalable dynamic cloud and web applications.

My favourite side project: My friend and I build a CRM platform called Icare when we were in college. We succesfully sold a customized version of the entire platform to a company and it is currently being used and maintained by them. Do check out the repo: https://github.com/ashinlaurel/icare-app
